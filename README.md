# Electronics II - Laboratory Projects & Circuit Simulations

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of laboratory exercises and circuit designs developed for the **Electronics II** course. The projects involve theoretical analysis, SPICE simulations, and experimental validation of various analog electronic configurations.

## 🚀 Overview
The focus of these projects was to design, simulate, and analyze high-performance analog circuits using Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), JFETs, and Operational Amplifiers.

## 🛠 Tools Used
* **Simulation:** SPICE (LTspice / PSpice)
* **Documentation:** LaTeX/PDF for theoretical analysis and experimental reports
* **Hardware Validation:** Oscilloscopes, Multimeters, and Signal Generators (Lab Environment)

## 📋 Key Projects Included

### 1. Differential Amplifiers
* Analysis of BJT differential pairs in comparator mode.
* Calculation of output waveforms, gain, and threshold voltages ($V_{UT}$, $V_{LT}$).
* Comparison between theoretical DC sweeps and SPICE simulations.

### 2. Cascode Amplifiers
* Design of a high-gain Cascode stage using JFET (Common Source) and BJT (Common Base).
* Frequency response analysis (AC Sweep) from 1Hz to 10MHz.
